# Engineering

This repository primarily contains documentation managed by the ENF Engineering team, but in some cases may also include experimental proof-of-concept code that does not fit into any other repository. The documentation is primary focused on development processes followed by the team and which may be valuable to outside contributors who wish to contribute to the code bases managed by ENF.

Development process is organized within the [process](process/) directory.

Some investigations into research and experimental code is contained within the [research](research/) directory.
