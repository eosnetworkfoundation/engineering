# AWS Account Migration
This document outlines the process to migrate an AWS account from one organization to another.

The EOS Network Foundation (ENF) Automation team had the foresight to create all cloud infrastructure in granular Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts, one for each system or environment, making this process as straightforward as possible!

## Architecture
The existing ENF AWS account architecture looks like this.

            billing -.-> reports
            billing -.- org
            org -.- policy
        end

        devhub["üìö devhub Account<br/><br/>Learn Portal"]
        docs["üìë docs-prod Account<br/><br/>Docs Portal"]
        mainnet["‚õìÔ∏è evm-mainnet Account<br/><br/>EVM Mainnet Endpoints"]
        testnet["üõ†Ô∏è evm-testnet Account<br/><br/>EVM Testnet Endpoints"]
    end

    org ===> chickens
    org ===> devhub
    org ===> docs
    org ===> mainnet
    org ===> testnet
```
Each child account is a "member" of the management account's "organization". The organization policy in the management account enforces consolidated billing, and prevents child accounts from leaving the organization.

Each EVM account looks like this.

            dns -.-> cdn
            cdn <--> waf
            waf <--> lb
            lb <--> vm
            vm <--> db

            dns -.-> metrics
            cdn -.-> metrics
            waf -.-> metrics
            lb -.-> metrics
            vm -.-> metrics

            metrics ---> notifications
        end

        groups ---> resources
    end

    internet((üåê))

    subgraph org["`**ENF Management Account**`"]
        enf((üèõÔ∏è))
    end

    internet -.-> dns
    internet <==> cdn
    internet ~~~ evm
    internet ~~~ iam

    notifications ---> internet

    enf -.-> |DNS| internet
    resources ---> |üí≤ Billing| enf
    enf ===x |Ownership| evm
```
You can see each account is isolated with its own security policy, IAM users, groups, and resources. DNS is delegated using public DNS infrastructure, not Route53 IAM, so DNS will continue to work during and after a migration.

## Prerequisites
There are a few prerequisites to consider before migrating an AWS account.

### ENF
The EOS Network Foundation (ENF) will need to do the following.
1. Determine who will perform the migration, presumably the Automation team.
1. Grant that user permissions to remove accounts from the organization.

### EOS Labs
EOS Labs will need to do the following.
1. Create an AWS account to serve as the management account, if they do not already have one.
    1. Setup billing.
    1. Create an AWS organization in that account.
    1. Create an organization policy that prevents child accounts from leaving the organization (optional).
1. Obtain a credit card to attach to the child accounts during the migration.
    - AWS requires a credit card to be attached to an account to remove it from an organization.

## Process
Once the prerequisites are met, the migration process will look like this.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor enf as ENF
    participant enfAWS as ENF<br/>Management<br/>Account
    participant acct as AWS Account
    participant labsAWS as EOS Labs<br/>Management<br/>Account
    actor labs as EOS Labs

    labs -->> enf: Provide Credit Card Info
    rect rgb(62, 101, 194)
        enf ->> acct: Add Credit Card to Billing Info
        acct ->> enfAWS: Remove Account from Organization
    end
    note over acct: Orphaned<br/>Account
    enf -->> labs: Transfer Root User Access
    rect rgb(253, 1, 193)
        labsAWS ->> acct: Invite Account to Organization
        acct ->> labsAWS: Accept Invitation
    end
```
This process must be repeated for each account to be migrated.
