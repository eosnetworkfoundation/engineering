# Engineering Tooling
Cheat sheets, links, procedures, and reference documents related to external tooling EOS Network Foundation developers and engineers use. For internal, in-house, or custom tooling, documentation should live in the repository with the tool source code and can be linked to from this `README.md`.

> [!TIP]
> If you are new here, start with the [computer setup guide](./computer-setup.md), then the [tool install guide](./tool-install-guide.md).
